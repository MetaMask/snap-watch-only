# Simple Keyring Snap

This repository contains a simple example of a keyring snap for watch-only accounts.

Keyring snaps enable developers to enhance MetaMask by adding new account
types. These accounts are natively supported within the extension, appearing in
MetaMask's UI, and can be used with dapps.

Watch-only snap accounts do not have private keys and the user is not be able to sign transactions and messages. This Snap allows the user to create a watch-only account or provide a public address and import a watch-only account into the MetaMask UI.

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities
of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that
can customize the wallet experience.
